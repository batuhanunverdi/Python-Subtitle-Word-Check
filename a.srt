1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,520
My bed, my bridal, all for misery. 

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,840
And I cannot... 

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,120
I cannot...save my child from death. 

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,800
This is one of the most shocking stories ever written. 

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,920
A mother, a princess, has lost her city and her husband in war. 

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,280
Now, she has to face the news that she is to be sold into slavery 

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,440
and her only son - killed. 

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,440
This film version of an ancient Greek play called Trojan Women 

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,320
has become a classic. 

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
The first time I saw it, I was moved to tears, and it still moves me now. 

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
It is a play about the most charged aspects of human life - 

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,320
love, war, sacrifice, fear and death. 

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,160
And although it is set amongst the gods, myths, 

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,960
and peoples of ancient Greece, it is still utterly gripping today. 

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,800
It is one of the main reasons I study Classics. 

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
An Athenian called Euripides wrote this play 

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
a little under two and a half thousand years ago. 

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,360
Back then, he was often ridiculed as an angry young man. 

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,600
But, over time, his plays have come to symbolise 

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
the incredible sophistication of ancient Greek civilisation. 

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,320
That civilisation has influenced almost every aspect of our lives. 

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,880
Not just drama, but politics, language, philosophy, 

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,480
art and architecture. 

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,360
To understand ourselves, it turns out, 

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
we need to understand the ancient Greeks. 

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,120
And the best seat from which to do that, for my money, 

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
is in the theatre. 

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,320
This series is about how ancient drama changed our world. 

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
It's the story of dramatists 

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,760
like Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, 

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,720
who revolutionised storytelling through plays 

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,320
like Trojan Women, Antigone, Oedipus, and The Oresteia. 

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,880
It's the story of how the Ancient Greeks 

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,680
gave birth to tragedy and comedy. 

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,960
And it's the story of how theatre spread throughout Greece and beyond, 

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
becoming a benchmark of civilisation, 

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,000
not just for Greeks, but for the world - 

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,720
then and now. 

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,080
In this episode, I want to journey to Athens 

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,400
to explore how drama first began. 

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,560
From the very start, it was about more than just entertainment - 

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,040
it was a reaction to real events, it was a driving force in history, 

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,680
and it was deeply connected to Athenian democracy. 

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,880
In fact, the story of theatre, IS the story of Athens - 

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,600
the cultural hub of ancient Greece 

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,640
and the stage for one of the greatest shows on earth. 

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,880
The story of drama as we know it begins in a particular place, 

48
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
and a particular time - 

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Athens in the 6th century before Christ. 

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,800
At that time, Greece was not a single country 

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,200
but a mass of competing city-states, or "poleis" - 

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,040
the Greek term describing a body of citizens. 

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
But in the late 6th century, the polis of Athens 

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,160
pulled ahead of the others - 

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,800
politically, economically and culturally. 

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,560
In the last part of the 6th century BC, 

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,680
Athens was the breeding ground for two extraordinary inventions. 

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
The first was democracy. 

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Athens was ruled, not by kings or by cliques of aristocrats, 

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,400
but by the votes of its own citizens. 

61
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
But the second was theatre. 

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,080
Athens invented an entirely new art form - drama. 

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,440
And these two inventions were tightly intertwined 

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,280
at the beating heart of Athenian society. 

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,440
And both of them were the result 

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
of an extraordinary cultural revolution. 

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
At this time, the whole of ancient Greek culture 

68
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,200
underwent a historic transformation. 

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,240
The revolution extended from architecture to literature, 

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
from vase painting to philosophy. 

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
You can see the impact of that revolution clearly 

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,920
in how Greek sculpture developed. 

73
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,080
In the middle 6th century it was rigid, stylised, 

74
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,560
lacking movement and life. 

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,480
But then things began to change. 

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
By the 5th century, Greek artists began 

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,720
to produce some of the greatest life-like sculptures ever made. 

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,880
It all amounted, not just to a new-looking world, 

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,680
but to a whole new view of the world. 

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,280
We call it the Classical World. 

81
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,880
And in this ground-breaking epoch, 

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,360
drama was perhaps the biggest innovation of them all. 

83
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,320
Tales of love, death and war had always been passed on 

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,120
by storytellers and epic poems like Homer's Iliad 

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,080
and savage myths had been celebrated in choral dance and song. 

86
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,560
BUT the Athenians added actors and invented the idea of performance. 

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,680
These epic stories would now play out, not only in the mind, 

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
but live on stage. 

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,560
This was more than innovation, this was a revolution. 

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,440
Never before in the Greek tradition that we know of, 

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
in the Greek storytelling tradition, 

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,760
were things enacted rather than narrated. 

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,760
So, instead of having, "And then the king drew his sword and said..." 

94
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,120
Instead, a person actually draws a sword and speaks. 

95
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,720
I know we sort of say, "Well, children do that" 

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,720
but to do it with serious storytelling, 

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,800
with storytelling that actually delves into 

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720
important roots in human behaviour, 

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,360
that is a very new step and to have it done in front of you, 

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,160
I think that must have been a very, very startling innovation. 

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,200
- ACTOR:
- The son of Thyestes... 

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,680
Ancient Greek drama looked 

103
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
and sounded very different from drama as we know it today. 

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
There were no more than three or four actors. 

105
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,440
There was a chorus who interrupted the action with song and dance, 

106
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,560
and all the performers wore masks. 

107
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,280
When an actor began to enact rather than narrate, 

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
there's a kind of dangerousness about that, 

109
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,320
that the actor has to become a woman, 

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,120
the actor has to become a slave, 

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
the actor, perhaps even more dangerously, 

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,720
has to become a god and it's almost as if the mask 

113
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,400
is a kind of signal of the profession, 

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,000
that protects the actor against the danger of doing these things. 

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,040
- ACTOR:
- Blood shoot of Aetrius... 

116
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,960
'The chorus are costumed and masked in an identical' 

117
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,720
or near identical way and they move and speak as a group. 

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
The chorus is not a bunch of individuals - 

119
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
for the Greeks, the chorus was a group. 

120
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,200
In which, in a sense, they submerged their identity. 

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,920
AND what the chorus does is, in its groupness, 

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,960
it tries to make sense of what it's witnessing. 

123
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,600
They're deeply emotionally involved, and the suffering becomes a song. 

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,040
And the chorus, as a group, with its group response, 

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,800
sings its choral lyrics. 

126
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,120
- ACTOR:
- He plotted it? Single-handed? The people will stone him. 

127
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,040
CHORUS: You don't stand a chance. 

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,240
It seems to me, that the crucial thing is that it is simultaneously 

129
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,840
a very strong emotional experience 

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,040
and a very strong thought experience. 

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,560
When the Greeks came to analyse their new art form, 

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
they discerned three different types of play. 

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Two of which we still have with us today - tragedy and comedy. 

134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,760
But, in many ways, modern tragedy has actually changed 

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
from how ancient tragedy worked. 

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,040
For us, tragedy is a play with a sad ending, 

137
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,240
but for the ancient Greeks, tragedy was a play 

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,360
in which the events offered the audience a tough decision. 

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,920
And because no real ancient tragedy ends conclusively - 

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,640
siding with one course of action or another - 

141
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,440
what it does is face the audience with a problem. 

142
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,520
What would THEY do if they were in the same situation? 

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,520
Take one of the most famous plays ever written - 

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,800
Oedipus The King by Sophocles. 

145
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,560
It tells the story of Oedipus, 

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,800
a man who was destined to kill his father and marry his mother. 

147
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
Although this outcome is predicted by an oracle, 

148
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
Oedipus himself makes a series of free choices 

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
that lead to its fulfilment - 

150
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
choices that would have posed serious questions for the audience. 

151
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,360
The play ends with Oedipus blinding himself in despair. 

152
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,000
The issues dealt with in tragedy were often so disturbing 

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,760
that the plays were nearly always set away from Athens, 

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,960
in the land of myth and legend, or at very least a far away city. 

155
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,840
And after a series of tragedies, 

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,160
the Athenians were offered a satyr play. 

157
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,840
Now, we don't have this any more today 

158
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,560
but effectively the satyrs 

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,960
were the half-male, half-goat companions of the god of revelry, 

160
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,840
who would be allowed to run around the stage 

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,800
doing lots of lewd and bawdy things as a bit of light relief. 

162
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
But what we do have today is comedy. 

163
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,400
And ancient comedy, just like tragedy, 

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,000
spoke directly to contemporary Athenians. 

165
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,880
Usually set in a topsy-turvy version of real life, 

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,960
or in a realm of fantasy, they poked fun at contemporary Athens. 

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,200
The Birds is a play that mocks the Athenian obsession 

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,560
with litigation and politics. 

169
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,320
It tells the story of two men 

170
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,120
who are tired of a life of law courts and civic duties. 

171
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,520
To escape, they turn themselves into birds 

172
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,600
and create a bird city-in-the-sky called Cloud Cuckoo Land 

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,520
where they reject all attempts to impose Athenian-style law and order. 

174
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,480
Both comedy and tragedy sought to have a direct bearing 

175
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
on life in Athens. 

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,840
And most fascinating of all, is how they seamlessly blended together 

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,080
religion and myth with contemporary politics. 

178
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,640
This means that a play like The Oresteia by Aeschylus 

179
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,640
can start with a mythic tale from the Trojan wars 

180
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,480
where Agamemnon is murdered by his wife and avenged by his son Orestes, 

181
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,760
but can end in a courtroom, in democratic Athens, 

182
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
with Orestes on trial for the murder of his mother. 

183
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,720
The Oresteia is one of the biggest hits in antiquity, 

184
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,280
it's also one of the very few trilogies that we've got. 

185
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,000
So what you have is three tragedies 

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,680
and, in this case, it's got a connected story. 

187
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,000
How does tragedy take this smorgasbord if you like, 

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,840
and make it into a story? 

189
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,160
Well it's not the same problem for the ancient Greeks 

190
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
as it might be for us. 

191
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,840
You know there's not this idea of anachronism. 

192
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,480
Your mythical world, with the gods, with the Trojan war - 

193
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,080
all of this that we've had in the first parts with the trilogy - 

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,560
can then end in that third part with a law court in Athens, 

195
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,840
which would have been familiar, of course, 

196
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,480
from 1st century contemporary Athens. 

197
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,080
So you have this brilliant genre 

198
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,000
where you can zoom from your present day into the past 

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
and bring your past into your present day. 

200
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
And it's that relationship, 

201
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,760
that tragedy uses to say things about its contemporary society. 

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,440
To find out more about how drama and democratic Athens 

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,760
became so intimately connected, 

204
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,400
I want to look at how theatre first emerged. 

205
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,200
Everything in ancient Greece 

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,960
came under the auspices of a particular god, 

207
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,360
and the god controlling theatre was called Dionysus. 

208
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,920
He was also the god of wine and revelry 

209
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,080
and many scholars think that theatre evolved directly 

210
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,080
out of the choral songs performed in honour of Dionysus. 

211
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,440
But there's also something else going on here. 

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,760
Something that is suggested by the ruins 

213
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,120
at a place called Thorikos, near Athens. 

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,680
This region was once home to the ancient Athenian silver mines 

215
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,320
but is also the site 

216
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,720
of the oldest stone-built theatre in the Greek world. 

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,400
We're in an industrial heartland of the ancient Athenian state, 

218
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,480
with the ore washeries and the mineshafts 

219
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
just beyond the theatre here. 

220
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
The first phase of this theatre is late 6th century 

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
and that puts it in the same time 

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,160
as the invention of Athenian democracy itself. 

223
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Which throws up another question - 

224
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,040
just what is the relationship between theatre and democracy? 

225
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,040
And how did the two help each other into being? 

226
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,840
It's a question that has been debated by scholars for centuries - 

227
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,840
were theatre and democracy connected from the very start? 

228
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Now I actually buy into the story that tragic drama 

229
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,000
IS a democratic invention. 

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,680
I have a particular take 

231
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,920
because I am one of those who think that Athenian tragic drama 

232
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,680
was deeply, strongly politicised. 

233
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,240
Not just, it happened in a polis but it happened in a polis 

234
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,800
of a particular sort and could not have happened before Athens 

235
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,080
became a polis of that particular sort, a democratic one. 

236
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,640
The theatrical side seems to coincide 

237
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,160
fairly closely with the political identity. 

238
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,280
Theatrical activities of some sort or another 

239
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
were one of the ways in which they expressed the fact 

240
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
that now they all belonged together, 

241
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,800
this was the place to which they came and in which they acted. 

242
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
It's about, you know, 

243
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
the local community feeling itself to be a local community. 

244
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm on my way to visit one of the smaller Athenian communities 

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
to try and find some more proof 

246
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,160
about the connection between drama and politics. 

247
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,240
I want to see what the archaeology itself has to say. 

248
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
Now, neither for theatre nor for democracy, 

249
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
was there any kind of immaculate conception. 

250
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
Nor were either born into the fully-developed form 

251
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,160
that we recognize them today. 

252
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,200
Both developed, arm-in-arm, over time. 

253
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,160
And all around us as we drive in Attica, 

254
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,720
we can see the building blocks, 

255
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,800
the basis of the Athenian democratic system. 

256
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,200
People tend to think of Athenians as city dwellers, 

257
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,960
but much of the population 

258
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,480
actually lived in village communities called demes. 

259
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,880
There were 139 demes making up the Athenian democracy 

260
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,400
and each deme governed itself. 

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,840
The deme I'm looking for is one of the remotest - 

262
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,040
it's called Rhamnous. 

263
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
The people who lived here were mostly farmers, 

264
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
but all the male citizens voted for the council, 

265
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,560
and on local regulations and on by-laws. 

266
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,840
And right at the heart of the community, 

267
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,280
are the remains of what was once a theatre. 

268
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,120
This is what I've come looking for on this very hot afternoon - 

269
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,840
an inscription that shows us democracy 

270
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,000
at its most local level in operation. 

271
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,520
"Dionisoi" - to Dionysus... 

272
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,200
"Hypo tes boules" - from the Boule, 

273
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,160
the local council controlling this deme, here in Attica. 

274
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,760
And it's to Dionysus because, yes, you've guessed it, 

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,720
we're in a theatre - a theatre, the space of Dionysus. 

276
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,400
The privileged seats for the distinguished local clientele, 

277
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,640
and the stage set out before us. 

278
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Religion, politics, theatre... 

279
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,240
at democracy's most local level. 

280
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,600
These theatres really were far more than just places of entertainment, 

281
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,920
they were places where the whole deme would gather together. 

282
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,360
No-one's going to bother to build a theatre 

283
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,320
just for a couple of days of drama a year. 

284
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,720
But the theatres here, 

285
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,920
at the lowest, most basic level of the Athenian democracy, 

286
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,760
seem to have also been used as multi-purpose civic spaces, 

287
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,840
giving them all-year-round potential, not just for drama, 

288
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,960
but also for democracy and democratic action itself. 

289
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,120
And THAT is what the archaeology is really beginning to uncover - 

290
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,080
not only the demes, but the deme theatres, 

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,960
spreading across all of Attica. 

292
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,040
The use of theatres for democratic activity 

293
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,640
seems to have been the case, not just in the demes, 

294
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,880
but in the city of Athens itself. 

295
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,440
Every year, the democratic authorities spent a fortune 

296
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,080
on the Great Dionysia Festival - a drama competition 

297
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,440
that took place in the Theatre of Dionysus 

298
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,920
in honour of the god of theatre. 

299
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,160
It's through understanding the different stages of this festival 

300
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,480
that we can get closer to understanding what ancient Athenians 

301
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,200
experienced when they watched and created drama. 

302
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,320
The festival began with a procession - 

303
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,760
a rowdy affair with feasting, drinking 

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,960
and a great crowd of people parading through the streets 

305
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,120
with a statue of the god and a small herd of sacrificial animals. 

306
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,160
When it reached the altar of the 12 Olympian Gods in the marketplace, 

307
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,840
the first thing that happened was a holy dance. 

308
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,640
The cult of Dionysus is very much 

309
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,680
a psychological thing. 

310
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,320
Wine was, of course, very important, 

311
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,480
everyone knows that, 

312
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,120
but the thing was that by drinking wine, 

313
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,800
you were getting closer to the god 

314
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,880
and the more wine you drink, the more you step out of yourself 

315
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,320
and get closer to the god. 

316
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,800
And that is also what happens when you're dancing, 

317
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,160
you're getting outside yourself, so to say, but also by, for example, 

318
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,200
wearing a mask... 

319
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
The ancient people thought that when you were wearing a mask, 

320
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,240
you really become someone else. 

321
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,320
- And the Greek word is... 
- It's ecstasies. 

322
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,840
- So "ec" - out, "stasis" - of one's self, of one's stance.
- Yes. 

323
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,840
- And that's our ecstasy. 
- It is the ecstasy as we know it. 

324
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
- The ecstasy of the god.
- Yeah. 

325
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,080
The procession then surged through the streets 

326
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,320
along a route lined with tripods - 

327
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,520
monuments put up by the proud sponsors of the winning plays. 

328
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,160
Often politicians, 

329
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,240
they spent fortunes funding dramatic productions, 

330
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,600
and marked their victories with monuments like this one - 

331
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,160
put up by a winner from the 4th century BC. 

332
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,480
So, the drama festival was more than an opportunity for staging plays, 

333
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,280
it was a chance for the leading figures of Athens 

334
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,360
to stage their generosity, and their success to the whole city. 

335
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,120
Finally, having wound its way right around the Acropolis, 

336
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,480
the procession emerged noisily into the precinct of Dionysus. 

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
By now, the participants were becoming a single entity. 

338
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,000
It was a religious but also a political incident, actually. 

339
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,960
You know, the whole city, so to say, 

340
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,960
steps toward the god 

341
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
in order to worship the god 

342
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,760
and they show not only their piety 

343
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,240
but also that they belong together. 

344
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,480
So... It's an extraordinary idea, isn't it? 

345
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,760
That when they take their seats in theatre, it's no longer, 

346
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,560
we would say in English, "It's no longer Joe Bloggs and somebody" - 

347
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,640
it's no longer the farmer and the individuals, 

348
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,280
it is a collective of people with a new identity 

349
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,400
- which is that of worshippers of the god Dionysus.
- Yes, correct. 

350
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,320
- It's a bit different to going to the theatre today, right?
- It is indeed. 

351
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,560
All of this put the audience into a receptive state 

352
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,360
for the drama competition that was to follow. 

353
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
But first, as they took their seats in the theatre, 

354
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,040
there was one more important set of rituals to come. 

355
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,960
The audience were seated here, 

356
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
perhaps in the same groupings as when they went to war. 

357
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,880
The citizens of Athens who were acting on the stage, 

358
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,600
were acting in the same groups as when they went to war. 

359
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,400
And in the front seats of the theatre were the reserved seats 

360
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,120
for various priests of the city, and for the important civic officials. 

361
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,040
And then, before the plays began, there were a series of events. 

362
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,600
First, a libation - an offering to the gods were poured 

363
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
in the centre of the stage by the generals, 

364
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,040
the military generals of the city. 

365
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,400
Then, a parade of tribute, 

366
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,760
of all the money paid by the cities and states of the Athenian empire 

367
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,480
to Athens, was literally taken across the stage, 

368
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,880
paraded in front of an audience that contained members 

369
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,680
from those same city-states which had to pay all that money. 

370
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,760
Then a list of all those who had benefited the city in some way 

371
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
was read out. 

372
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,840
And finally, onto the stage were brought the orphans, 

373
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,800
those whose parents had died fighting for the city in battle 

374
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,920
and whom the city would now 

375
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,000
take on the expenses of bringing up and educating. 

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,520
They came on, dressed themselves in the armour of war 

377
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,080
and took their seats, their special seats here in the theatre. 

378
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,360
Only then could the plays begin. 

379
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,080
From dawn until dusk, for five days, 

380
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,840
the citizen audience watched three playwrights 

381
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,880
each put on three tragedies as well as a farcical satyr play, 

382
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,400
and some comedies. 

383
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,600
At their heart were issues of justice and loyalty, 

384
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
war and peace, vengeance and compassion, 

385
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,040
which sent powerful messages to the citizen audience. 

386
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
In the centuries of Athens' greatness, 

387
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,920
over 1,000 plays were written for the Dionysia. 

388
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,480
But today, just 32 of them survive in full. 

389
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,640
And those 32 have survived, in part, 

390
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,240
because they were considered to be the greatest. 

391
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,160
And they were all written by just three people - 

392
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,080
Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides - 

393
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,320
the great tragedians of the 5th century BC. 

394
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Aeschylus was the first. 

395
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
He was the author of the Oresteia, 

396
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,560
the only whole trilogy to have survived. 

397
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,240
Sophocles wrote two of the most enduring plays - 

398
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360
Oedipus The King and Antigone, 

399
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,280
which tells the tragic story of Oedipus' daughter 

400
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,840
who is sentenced to death 

401
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,200
for breaking the law and burying her rebel brother. 

402
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,960
But, of all the playwrights, Euripides is now considered 

403
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,280
in many ways to have been the best. 

404
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,440
He wrote the play Medea, with its shocking tale 

405
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
of a woman betrayed by her husband 

406
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,800
who takes revenge by killing her own children. 

407
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,600
The playwrights of ancient Athens were all gurus of the city 

408
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,320
in one form or another - Aeschylus the war hero, 

409
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,560
Sophocles the civic official, 

410
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,400
and Euripides, the sort of enfant terrible of Athenian society. 

411
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,720
The Greek word for playwright is "didaskalos", 

412
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,000
which means "trainer", or "teacher". 

413
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,680
Now, in part, that refers to the playwright's role 

414
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,960
in training the chorus for their play, 

415
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,480
BUT many believe it also refers to the role of the playwright 

416
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,920
in training the audience for participation in democracy itself. 

417
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,600
If we take Sophocles' Ajax, as an example - 

418
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
it's a retelling of a classic myth 

419
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,760
set in the time of the legendary war between the Greeks and the Trojans. 

420
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
And, on the one hand, it's just that 

421
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,360
but on the other it's also a lesson, 

422
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,360
a lesson in the sacrifices that have to be made for democracy to work. 

423
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,520
Ajax was one of the warriors who fought with the Greeks at Troy. 

424
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,320
After the death of Achilles, the greatest hero of them all, 

425
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,040
the Greeks take a vote on who should get his weapons. 

426
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,320
They choose Odysseus, not Ajax, and Ajax is furious. 

427
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,080
Unable to accept the result of the vote, he goes on a killing spree. 

428
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,800
And ultimately, consumed by the shame of his actions - 

429
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,600
he is driven to suicide. 

430
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,600
The motor of this play is a vote - 

431
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,680
a process that would have been very familiar 

432
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,360
to the democratic citizens of ancient Athens. 

433
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,040
But it's a vote that Ajax refuses to accept. 

434
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,800
Ajax is the antithesis of the good democratic citizen. 

435
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,560
But the play also goes further. 

436
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,760
Because, for me, the key moment 

437
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,960
is actually what happens after Ajax's death. 

438
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,080
What Sophocles has the other Greeks do 

439
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,680
is debate about how they should proceed. 

440
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,000
And some argue that Ajax should not be buried because of his actions 

441
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,160
but Odysseus steps in to argue that he should be buried. 

442
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,480
"Do not fling his body out unburied, treated so unfeelingly. 

443
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,200
"And don't let force have such control of you that you allow 

444
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,320
"your hate to trample justice down." 

445
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,600
For scholars, this is the critical point in the play. 

446
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,520
There's a real danger in Ajax 

447
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
that because you've got these two extraordinary episodes 

448
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
that are bloody and shocking, 

449
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
you think the play is about those two episodes 

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,680
that are bloody and shocking. 

451
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,520
But I think the play is about the process of debate 

452
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,840
that leads to decisions 

453
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,160
in the wake of actions that really you haven't been able to cope with. 

454
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,600
So, this is a play that stages debate 

455
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
and it stages it in all its forms. 

456
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,440
One way of thinking about Ajax is as a hermetical bronze age 

457
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,680
or archaic warrior stuck in a much more modern political system. 

458
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,600
He has values about being an individual and being a hero, 

459
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,200
not being a co-operative person... 

460
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,080
that make him very difficult, 

461
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,560
as if individuals can no longer be powerful figures in a democracy. 

462
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,880
- A man out of time, out of place? 
- Yes. 

463
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,400
So, this may be someone who is hardly a role model citizen 

464
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,440
but there are going to be lots of people in Athens 

465
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,040
who are hardly role model citizens. 

466
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,480
Athens, no doubt, had its own fair share of bigheads 

467
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,920
and glory seekers - people who just wouldn't work within the democracy. 

468
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,680
And this play plays out the dilemma 

469
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
of what do you do with those kinds of people? 

470
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,760
How do you keep the democracy on track? 

471
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,080
And that, for me, is why Odysseus' intervention is so crucial, 

472
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,840
because he shows that you need to have empathy with these people 

473
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,080
and you need to let justice run its course. 

474
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
Odysseus offers a way for the community 

475
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,880
to come back together, make a joint decision and move forward. 

476
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,040
And that's why this play is such a great example 

477
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,080
of what theatre did in ancient Athenian society - 

478
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
it told a story, it posed problems, 

479
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,400
it asked questions, questions of the audience 

480
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,040
about what would you do in this kind of situation, 

481
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,560
a situation which they would undoubtedly have to face up to 

482
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,000
at some point in their lives. 

483
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,720
Theatre was vital to the processes that played out 

484
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,960
here on the Pnyx, home of the Athenian assembly. 

485
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,640
It was the oil that allowed democracy to function. 

486
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,920
A contained space which allowed for a continual process 

487
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,760
of risky reflection, self-doubt and debate. 

488
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,200
It's no accident that the most important words 

489
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,080
in any Greek tragedy are "Ti draso?" - 

490
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,400
"What shall I do?" 

491
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,840
Theatre and democracy had grown up together 

492
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,840
and were now inextricably linked in Athenian minds 

493
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,880
and every year, for almost the next two centuries, 

494
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,400
the Athenians came to the theatre 

495
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,880
to rework the old myths into tragic dramas 

496
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,840
that spoke to the problems that had beset 

497
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,760
and were fundamental 

498
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,920
to one of the most important and interesting stories in history - 

499
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,600
The Rise and Fall of Athens. 

500
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,760
And, at the same time, those very same people were here, 

501
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,680
in the assembly, making the decisions 

502
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
that affected those events. 

503
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,480
It's therefore no surprise 

504
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,600
that a common subject matter in Athenian drama 

505
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,040
was a problem that constantly dogged the Athenian assembly - war. 

506
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,840
And one war in particular fired the imagination 

507
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
of the playwright Aeschylus, 

508
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,720
who lived through the real life drama 

509
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,680
and was inspired to write what is now 

510
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,400
the first ancient Greek play to survive in full. 

511
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,320
In 490 BC, less than 20 years after the democracy was established, 

512
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,880
Athens was attacked by the greatest power on earth - the Persian empire. 

513
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,440
The first crisis came at Marathon, 26 miles from the city of Athens. 

514
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,120
A Persian fleet arrived with an enormous army. 

515
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Although outnumbered, the Athenians attacked, 

516
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,520
and against all the odds, they triumphed. 

517
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,240
The Athenian dead were commemorated by a memorial barrow 

518
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,840
near the battlefield, 

519
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,720
which is impressive even today. 

520
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,400
But ten years later, the Persians were back with an army 

521
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,840
said to have been more than a million strong. 

522
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,480
As it bore down on Athens, the assembly passed a heroic decree 

523
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,960
at the urging of a leading general called Themistocles. 

524
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,520
Amazingly, a later copy of the decree 

525
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,640
actually survives in an Athens museum. 

526
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,000
This is one of the most evocative inscriptions surviving to us today. 

527
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,360
It's a decree of the people of Athens and here's the key word - 

528
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,240
"Salamina" - Salamis. 

529
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,320
This is the decree recording the decision 

530
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,720
by the Athenian people to evacuate their home city 

531
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,040
and go to the island of Salamis 

532
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,040
to save themselves from the invading hordes of Persians. 

533
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,840
This is the record of one of the most key moments 

534
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,640
in the whole of ancient history. 

535
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,440
The Athenians abandoned their city and took to their ships, 

536
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,560
leaving only a few men barricaded on the Acropolis. 

537
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,640
The Persians ransacked the city, destroying the temples. 

538
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,720
But the Athenian gamble paid off - 

539
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,200
the Athenian fleet defeated the Persians 

540
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,320
in the narrows off Salamis. 

541
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,800
Greece was saved. 

542
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,360
And witnessing it all, not from afar but at close range, was Aeschylus. 

543
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,160
Aeschylus wasn't just a playwright - he was also a soldier. 

544
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,880
He stood in the Athenian ranks on the plane at Marathon, 

545
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,360
on that fateful day when the Persians first arrived. 

546
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,480
He was part of the victorious Athenian army, 

547
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,240
but he also lost his brother on the battlefield. 

548
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
Aeschylus, in his own epitaph, 

549
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,920
preferred to be remembered for his role here at Marathon, 

550
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
rather than for his plays. 

551
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Without doubt, it was his extraordinary experiences 

552
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,560
here on the battlefield that gave him a unique perspective 

553
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,320
and allowed him to represent war on stage 

554
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,160
in a way that has echoed ever since. 

555
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,320
Aeschylus composed over 90 plays in his lifetime 

556
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,160
and of the few that survive, 

557
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,960
the play that he composed about these great events 

558
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,040
is one of the most moving, and one of the most fascinating. 

559
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,280
In 472 BC, Aeschylus produced a play called The Persians, 

560
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,480
and it's the first ancient tragedy to survive to us in full today. 

561
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,160
Its sponsor was no-one less than the future democratic hero Pericles. 

562
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,560
But what's really surprising about it is its subject matter, 

563
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,720
because it tells the story of how the Persians 

564
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,360
reacted to the news of their defeat at the battle of Salamis, 

565
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,560
a battle that those in the audience had fought and won 

566
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,600
just eight years before. 

567
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,400
The play is set in the Persian capital. 

568
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,680
A messenger arrives at the Persian court 

569
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,880
with the news of the Greek victory. 

570
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,640
The Persians cannot believe that they have been defeated, 

571
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
and they fall to pieces. 

572
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
In their misery, 

573
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,640
they summon the ghost of the previous King Darius for advice. 

574
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
The ghost of Darius tells the Persians 

575
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,840
that they themselves are to blame for their defeat, 

576
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,480
because their pride and their ambition 

577
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,680
has led them to disregard the gods. 

578
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,240
"The voiceless heaps of slaughtered corpses shall eloquently show 

579
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,080
"that no one human should puff up inflated thoughts. 

580
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,280
"You see how insolence, once opened into flower, 

581
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,000
"produces fields ripe with calamity 

582
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,600
"and reaps a harvest-home of sorrow." 

583
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,840
This is the crucial theme of the play. 

584
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Well, I think, really, at its heart, it's almost a tragedy about hubris. 

585
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,720
- Hmm.
- This idea of, sometimes translated as "arrogance", 

586
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,800
something like that - going too far, crossing a line, transgressing. 

587
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
And the Persians had done that. 

588
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,560
They thought big, they thought they could go and take Greece. 

589
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,760
They didn't win and, actually, 

590
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,200
part of what the play is exploring 

591
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,000
is the idea that big empires can fall. 

592
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,680
What kind of resonance 

593
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,360
and implications does a play like The Persians have for us today? 

594
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,480
It deals with one of these eternal themes - it looks at war. 

595
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,200
It looks at the destruction, the loss, 

596
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,000
the risks you run if you go to war. 

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,440
They became really popular with the Gulf War 

598
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,960
and with the Iraq War as well and this is a really interesting one. 

599
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,800
In some modern productions, 

600
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,720
what you get is costume that really tells you 

601
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,400
that the audience should be making a link with contemporary war. 

602
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,800
What point is Aeschylus making, do you think, with that? 

603
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,840
I mean this is an amazingly difficult question to answer, 

604
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,640
you can't even imagine how this must have felt for the audience. 

605
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,920
They'd had their city sacked, they'd really come close 

606
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,040
to being completely occupied by Persia. 

607
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,400
- This play is, on one level really celebratory...
- Yeah. 

608
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,720
But you have to imagine it operating on another level as well 

609
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,560
because there are incredibly moving speeches in this - 

610
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,440
the language isn't just victorious, if you like. 

611
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,960
I think it tells us a lot about what tragedy is doing, 

612
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,200
it is complex and it doesn't make it easy on the audience 

613
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,360
and it's really asking the society to reflect. 

614
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,840
This play, for me, is both an exception to normal tragedy 

615
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,480
AND a fantastic example of it. 

616
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,560
It's an exception because unlike most that focus on mythical stories, 

617
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,600
this focuses on real and recent history. 

618
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,960
But it's a fantastic example of what tragedy does 

619
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,160
because it doesn't just allow the Athenians 

620
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,800
to gloat over their victory. 

621
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,560
Instead, it offers a warning. 

622
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,880
For the Persians, pride came before a fall, 

623
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,560
and at a time when Athens and the Athenians 

624
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,160
were beginning to grow in their own power within the Greek world, 

625
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,440
the play offers that same message - 

626
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,640
"be careful or you too could end up just like the Persians." 

627
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,440
This warning had a direct bearing on the current situation in Athens. 

628
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,640
In the aftermath of the Persian wars, 

629
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,800
Athens reached the peak of her power and influence 

630
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,080
and the fleet that had secured victory at Salamis 

631
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,520
now reached out across the Aegean. 

632
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,600
Athens became the leading city-state in a new anti-Persian alliance. 

633
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,080
But what began as a free coalition, was soon under Athenian control. 

634
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,000
The financial muscle at Athens' command allowed it eventually 

635
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,800
to turn the free alliance of Greek cities and states, 

636
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,040
that had been brought together to wreak revenge on the Persians, 

637
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,800
into an empire solely to support the glory of Athens. 

638
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,600
And it was policed by the mighty 

639
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,960
and yet brutal majesty of the supreme Athenian fleet. 

640
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,680
The war-chest for that free alliance, 

641
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,080
which had been kept on the sacred island of Delos, 

642
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,040
was moved to Athens, placed on the Acropolis 

643
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,840
and eventually into a building - the Parthenon - 

644
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,120
which has today become synonymous with democracy and freedom. 

645
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,680
And yet which was originally built 

646
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,880
with the blood-money of Athenian empire. 

647
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,000
Every year, each city in the alliance or empire, 

648
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,560
contributed money in silver as tribute, 

649
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,880
and this money was displayed in the theatre, in Athens, 

650
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
at the Great Dionysia Festival. 

651
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,000
But when any members of the empire refused these payments, 

652
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,640
Athens sent a fleet to attack them. 

653
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,200
Having an empire meant that the Athenian assembly 

654
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,520
was now making life-or-death decisions, 

655
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,720
not just about themselves but about cities and peoples far away 

656
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,840
who had no real say in the matter. 

657
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,720
These decisions were far from easy, as the Athenians discovered 

658
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,160
when they had to decide how to deal with the city of Mytilene. 

659
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,360
In 428 BC, the city of Mytilene 

660
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,320
rebelled against the Athenian empire. 

661
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,560
The Athenian assembly met to decide how to respond. 

662
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,200
The hardliners wanted to execute every man 

663
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,440
and enslave every woman in the city - 

664
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,520
the moderates just to execute the ringleaders. 

665
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,840
On the first day of debate, 

666
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,320
the Athenian assembly sided with the hardliners. 

667
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,680
They even dispatched a trireme to Mytilene to carry out those orders. 

668
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,800
And yet when they met on the second day, 

669
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,480
the Athenian assembly started to doubt its own decision. 

670
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,560
And indeed they went on to reverse it, sending a second trireme 

671
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,080
which got there just in time. 

672
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,320
Now these events not only brought great relief to the Mytileneans 

673
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,240
but it also brought home to the Athenians the critical importance 

674
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,480
of thinking through properly their decisions before taking action. 

675
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,920
Dealing with life and death decisions like this 

676
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,120
had always lain at the heart of Athenian drama. 

677
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,960
And authors like the prize-winning Sophocles forced the audience 

678
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,320
to experience vicariously the consequences of sloppy thinking. 

679
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,400
In 442 BC, Sophocles won yet another victory at the City Dionysia 

680
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
with his play Antigone. 

681
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,840
Now, Sophocles was a man intensely involved 

682
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,600
with the affairs of the Athenian state. 

683
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,240
He had been a general and he would go on 

684
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,400
to become one of its closest advisers 

685
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,120
during its darkest hours in future years. 

686
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,920
And his play Antigone deals with exactly this kind of thing - 

687
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,040
how to debate and argue through the difficult 

688
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,160
and yet critical issues that face a city. 

689
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,440
And what can happen when it all goes terribly wrong. 

690
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,000
The play tells the sad story of Oedipus' daughter Princess Antigone. 

691
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,160
When Antigone buries the body of her rebel brother, 

692
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,600
she is following the law of the gods. 

693
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,560
But the city's law and her uncle, King Creon have forbidden it. 

694
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,840
Creon is furious, and condemns her to death. 

695
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,040
Creon's son Haemon, who is in love with Antigone, 

696
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,480
urges his father to reconsider. 

697
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,440
He argues that "A city is not a city if it is the holding of one man." 

698
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,840
But Creon is stubborn and uncompromising. 

699
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,240
He refuses to listen, and refuses to back down. 

700
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,640
The play ends with Antigone and Haemon both committing suicide 

701
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,680
and with Creon facing the displeasure of his people 

702
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,960
and of the gods. 

703
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,360
Creon has to face the fact that his actions, 

704
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,720
and his alone, have caused this disaster. 

705
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,720
All of Greek tragedy stages dilemmas that cities under leaders have, 

706
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,520
where they're faced with either very bad luck 

707
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,880
or very bad management, or both. 

708
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,760
Now, at one end of that spectrum you've got Oedipus, 

709
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,520
who has very, very, very bad luck - he's doomed before he's even born. 

710
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,200
How do you react to that? 

711
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,520
How do you conduct yourself in a situation with very bad luck? 

712
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,760
Right at the other end is the story of Oedipus' daughter Antigone, 

713
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,320
faced with THE most incompetent leader in all of Greek literature 

714
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,200
and that is saying something. 

715
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Creon simply cannot put a foot right, so Sophocles is asking people 

716
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,920
to think about what a good leader might be 

717
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,600
through showing them the worst possible leader 

718
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,240
and the Athenians loved that 

719
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,640
so much that Antiquity said they made him general in response. 

720
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,880
Creon is getting pretty a bad stick from Edith 

721
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,560
but there is a real sense in which the issue at the centre of the play 

722
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,000
is an issue that arises even in Athenian law. 

723
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
In Athenian law, if someone is a traitor 

724
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,400
they are not to be buried - 

725
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,760
you have to take them beyond the borders 

726
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,760
and you can then bury them outside. 

727
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,040
If you're a dimark in Athens 

728
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,480
and there is a dead body in your deign you are obliged to bury it. 

729
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,760
So, immediately that clash of, 

730
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
"Yes, you must bury it but no, you can't" 

731
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,320
arises if the dead body happens to be a traitor. 

732
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,000
So this isn't a non issue, this is a real issue 

733
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,200
and Creon may make a complete fist of resolving it 

734
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,000
but he makes a fist because 

735
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,360
there are two diametrically opposed, justifiable views 

736
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,120
and you then have to pick your way through these. 

737
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,920
Due to his dogged determination for others to do 

738
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,400
exactly what he wants, his inability to listen, to compromise, 

739
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,760
Creon ends up paying the ultimate price - 

740
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,320
the loss of his family and his authority. 

741
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,120
It's a play about listening, debate, compromise, 

742
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,080
what it takes to be a leader. 

743
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,920
Those are issues which, of course, had relevance 

744
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,720
to the ancient Athenians watching the play, 

745
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,360
but they're also issues that are relevant to any society at any time. 

746
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,000
That's what makes Antigone so timeless. 

747
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,600
It's got universal appeal because it's about someone 

748
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,840
fighting against the system and a system that's wrong. 

749
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,360
I mean, that's how it gets picked up now 

750
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,360
and that's what really appeals to modern audiences, I think, about it. 

751
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,760
A play like Antigone, 

752
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,760
what kind of resonance does that have for us today? 

753
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,240
Thinking about this adaptation that Jean Anouilh 

754
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,800
produced in 1944 in France while it was being occupied by Nazis - 

755
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,680
that's a real example where you've got this play 

756
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,640
which is really taken on and championed by the Resistance. 

757
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,680
How did it ever get permission to be performed 

758
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,320
if it's such a play of resistance? 

759
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,640
Well, I think that's the ambiguity of the play. 

760
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,080
So, for the occupying force, for the Vichy government, 

761
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,720
actually, you can look at this play and think, 

762
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,920
"This is a play about law and imposing law" 

763
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,200
and actually this is a silly little girl 

764
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,960
who breaks that law and she gets what's coming to her. 

765
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,080
So, it's that ambiguity that allows, even in those circumstances, 

766
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,160
this great play of resistance, for some people, to be put on. 

767
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,560
Tragedy was an effective way of engaging with the issues 

768
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,520
that beset the democracy, but it was not the only way. 

769
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,800
There was also comedy. 

770
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,760
Comedy was irreverent, rude and bawdy, 

771
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,680
and it was also personal, targeting real individuals. 

772
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,400
And just like today, ordinary Athenians in the marketplace 

773
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,720
were deeply suspicious of their elected political leaders. 

774
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,400
Some people, it seems, were just naturally born 

775
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,960
to successfully navigate 

776
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,320
the slippery waters of Athenian politics. 

777
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,720
And one of those guys was a man called Cleon. 

778
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,960
HE SPEAKS GREEK 

779
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,000
Now, Cleon was what we would call today an opportunistic politician. 

780
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,440
He would be with the aristocrats or he would be spurring 

781
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,040
on the lowest of the low of the Athenian citizenry. 

782
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,040
And the ancient commentators are fairly hard on Cleon. 

783
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,280
Today we'd probably be a bit more balanced, 

784
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,080
but without a shadow of a doubt 

785
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,560
he would do whatever it took to get whatever he wanted. 

786
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,200
Naturally, he had his enemies. 

787
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,680
They accused him of being greedy, not just for power, 

788
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,360
but for fresh-caught tuna, 

789
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,200
seen back then as a luxury desired by the rich and anti-democratic. 

790
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,400
How could the democracy keep people like this in check 

791
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,920
while not killing off their energy and enthusiasm 

792
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,840
that at the end of the day benefited the city? 

793
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, one of the ways they did it was in the theatre, 

794
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,680
by taking the piss out of them, right in their very face. 

795
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,200
Comedies, while performed at the Dionysia Festival, 

796
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,800
also had their own smaller festival. 

797
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,960
It was called the Lenaia. 

798
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,400
It took place early in January, 

799
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,760
long before the season for sailing started, 

800
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,240
so there were no foreigners present. 

801
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
This meant that comic writers could really let rip 

802
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,000
without letting the city down. 

803
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,800
What you have is really lively plays, 

804
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,200
very outrageous plays sometimes 

805
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,320
but they are politically involved. 

806
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,960
The settings can be amazing in the real sense, incredible. 

807
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,040
You have comedies that go to the underworld, 

808
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,360
they go to hell 

809
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,880
and that's where you get these animal choruses like frogs. 

810
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,080
This is a frog that was used 

811
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,160
in the King's College Greek play. 

812
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,280
Animal choruses are quite common in comedy. 

813
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,840
You've got, for example, the chorus here... 

814
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,720
These guys performing and the songs that they get to sing, 

815
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,960
I mean, this is a great source of comedy. 

816
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,600
What kind of level of biting satire are we talking about here 

817
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,080
in ancient comedy? 

818
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,800
It's extremely personal, 

819
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,280
there's insults really of quite an infantile nature. 

820
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,920
You have plays which put politicians as one of the characters, 

821
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,760
very thinly disguised, 

822
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
but they'll be the leading politicians of the day. 

823
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,360
Their policies will be clear, the way they speak might be parodied, 

824
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,920
even the mask can reflect characters from Athenian society. 

825
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,600
This was the sort of thing that lay in store 

826
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,200
for ambitious politicians like Cleon. 

827
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,280
And the man who was the real expert at this 

828
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,760
was a comic playwright called Aristophanes. 

829
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,200
And for Aristophanes and Cleon, it was a grudge match - 

830
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,520
they even came from the same village. 

831
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,200
In 425 BC, Aristophanes wrote a play called The Knights. 

832
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,880
It portrays Cleon as a cunning servant 

833
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
working for an old man called Demos. 

834
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,560
Demos represents the people, and as his crafty servant, 

835
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,880
Cleon misuses his position 

836
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,720
for the purposes of extortion and corruption. 

837
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,800
Yet, in the end, is it Demos who has the last laugh. 

838
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,200
Cleon's corrupt ways are exposed, he loses his position 

839
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,360
and he is reduced to selling sausages 

840
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,720
outside the Athens' city gates. 

841
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,160
Aristophanes didn't pull any punches - 

842
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,240
this play brings Cleon right back down to earth. 

843
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,440
And, of course, the politicians, 

844
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,200
about whom the jokes were being made, 

845
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,440
were right here, visible to all in the audience. 

846
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,400
So it's like having one of our shows, 

847
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,520
The Daily Show in the States or Have I Got News For You here, 

848
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,800
being played out in an important civic space - 

849
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,160
the Capitol or the House of Commons - 

850
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,200
with the people they're taking the piss out of 

851
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,960
sitting right here in the audience, 

852
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,760
having to take it in front of everyone. 

853
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,520
The Greeks even had a word for this - 

854
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,080
they called these people, the "komedoumenoi", 

855
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,040
those made fun of in comedy. 

856
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,480
And this isn't just some sort of sideshow. 

857
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,360
This, many ancient commentators saw, 

858
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,440
as the hallmark of ancient Athenian democracy 

859
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,720
and of freedom and free speech. 

860
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,280
The laughter didn't stop Cleon's career. 

861
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,360
Despite his slippery reputation, he was elected again and again. 

862
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,680
But the effect of comedy was more subtle than that. 

863
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,720
What it did do, was police the boundaries of behaviour, 

864
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,600
skewer pretensions and remind those in positions of power 

865
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,760
of their responsibilities and of the limits of their ambitions. 

866
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,400
It's a kind of satire that we can still see at work 

867
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,800
in our own democracy today. 

868
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,040
By the time of Cleon, this experiment in Athenian democracy 

869
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,400
was heading towards its centenary. 

870
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,480
And in that time it had seen it all, from fighting for survival, 

871
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,400
to cultural supremacy, to empire, to wealth. 

872
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,040
And it was, still, at war, not now with Persia 

873
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,960
but with Greece's greatest fighting force - the Spartans. 

874
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,480
And desperate times called for desperate measures. 

875
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,240
The war between Sparta and Athens started in 431 BC 

876
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,360
and lasted for decades. 

877
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,200
It was a fight to the death. 

878
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,920
Sparta ruled by land, Athens ruled at sea. 

879
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,680
But there was one island 

880
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,200
that had never submitted to Athenian domination 

881
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,480
and tried instead to remain neutral - 

882
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,800
the small island of Melos. 

883
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:09,640
In 416 BC, the Athenian democrats had had enough - 

884
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,880
it was time for the Melians to submit. 

885
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,640
So the Athenians sent their fleet to enforce their demands. 

886
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,440
Now, according to Thucydides, the contemporary Athenian historian, 

887
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,440
the Athenians sent in not just their fleet 

888
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,480
but also some diplomats to put the case. 

889
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,080
The case was very simple, it was this - join us or die. 

890
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,320
But what happened next, according to Thucydides, 

891
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,000
was an extraordinary debate between the two sides. 

892
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,240
"These envoys the Melians did not bring before the popular assembly, 

893
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,680
"but bade them tell in the presence of the magistrates 

894
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,800
"and the few what they had come for." 

895
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,760
The envoys gave the Melians an ultimatum - 

896
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,840
surrender and pay tribute to Athens or be destroyed. 

897
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,680
The Melians argued that they were a neutral city, not an enemy. 

898
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,520
And that it would be shameful and cowardly to submit without a fight. 

899
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,960
But the Athenians were unmoved - 

900
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,320
they countered that if they didn't extract surrender from Melos, 

901
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,480
the empire would look weak. 

902
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,440
They argued that the strong have the right to exert their authority. 

903
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,880
This is a classic example 

904
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,520
of what we call in Greek an "agon" - a debate. 

905
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,040
You could have seen it in the philosophical lecture hall 

906
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,320
or in the political assembly or in the law courts, 

907
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,480
or indeed on the stage in the theatre. 

908
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,320
And it's summed up... Well, it's summed up rather well, actually, 

909
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,280
by an enthusiastic student who seems to have had this copy before me. 

910
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,320
And who has written rather pithily in the margin, "Might is right". 

911
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,000
And that was the Athenian argument. 

912
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,960
The strong do as they can. 

913
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,680
The weak suffer what they must. 

914
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,440
And that's exactly what happened. 

915
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,480
The Athenians invaded the island of Melos, 

916
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,000
they executed all the men, 

917
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,040
they enslaved all the women and the children, 

918
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,040
and they established an Athenian colony there. 

919
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,000
And yet, just the very next year, in the Theatre of Dionysus, 

920
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,880
in the centre of Athens, 

921
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,520
Euripides, the enfant terrible of Athenian drama, 

922
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,920
staged a play called Trojan Women. 

923
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,240
Its subject matter was what happened to the women at Troy 

924
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,120
after the Greeks had besieged, invaded and destroyed the city. 

925
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,400
So the Athenians sat down to watch a play 

926
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,600
which laid before them on the stage 

927
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:24,440
the tragic reality of what they had done, 

928
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,000
just the year before, to the island of Melos. 

929
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,240
The play is set in the aftermath of the legendary siege of Troy. 

930
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,400
The city has fallen, all the Trojan men are dead, 

931
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,320
and the surviving Trojan women, 

932
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:45,600
who make up the chorus in the play, are to be sold into slavery. 

933
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,120
But for Princess Andromache, there's worse - 

934
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,880
her son is to be taken from her and slaughtered. 

935
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,600
When she argues, the messenger tells her to be brave - "might is right". 

936
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,080
SHE WAILS 

937
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,480
WOMEN ALL SCREAM 

938
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,920
MAN: Hush. 

939
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,760
SHE PANTS 

940
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,240
If you say words that make the army angry... 

941
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,680
..the child will have no burial... 

942
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,040
..and without pity... 

943
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,800
So bear your fate as best you can. 

944
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,120
Then you need not leave him dead without a grave... 

945
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,880
..and you will find the Greeks... 

946
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,120
more kind. 

947
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,960
Trojan Women may well have spoken to Athenian actions on Melos, 

948
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,200
but Euripides was also crucially 

949
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,000
sending a broader message about the disillusionment 

950
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,680
that was taking hold in Greece 

951
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,280
after years of relentless, savage war 

952
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,480
and the terrible impact 

953
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,440
that such conflict has on all members of society. 

954
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,680
Why should WE think that what the Athenians did to the Melians 

955
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,200
would have generated such terrific outrage 

956
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,280
when the Spartans had done something 

957
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,840
- very similar to the people of Hisiai just a few years earlier.
- Exactly. 

958
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,800
I mean that's purely historically. 

959
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,640
On the other hand, the coincidence of date means, 

960
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,520
it seems to me, that as Euripides is writing this, 

961
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,800
what is the big campaign the Athenians are involved in 

962
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,480
that is going to involve women as slaves of war? 

963
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,680
Well, there is no other campaign going on 

964
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:43,920
as Euripides is writing it in the winter of 416-5 

965
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,240
but he could have thought it at any time, that's the thing. 

966
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,520
By 416/415, I think Euripides really has seen that war 

967
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,920
as a way of life brings nothing but misery 

968
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,080
to both victors and vanquished. 

969
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,280
And from that point of view, if you focus on Melos, 

970
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,680
- you actually miss that point. 
- Exactly. 

971
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,760
The more you think that this is a sort of, 

972
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,600
- "Oh, there's been a terrible atrocity..."
- Yes.
- Exactly. 

973
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,160
..the more you miss 

974
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,800
that this is about war and how irrational and terrible. 

975
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,960
Euripides is presenting a view of all the Greeks 

976
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,400
as having barbarised themselves 

977
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,640
during the course of the Peloponnesian War. 

978
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,440
Euripides was not the only one 

979
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,000
to despair at the state of affairs in Greece, 

980
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,680
or criticise Athenian behaviour. 

981
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,240
Many in Greece now felt that Athens was guilty of hubris, 

982
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,040
of over-reaching pride. 

983
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,120
And anyone who had ever seen a Greek tragedy 

984
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,560
would have been aware of what could happen next. 

985
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,280
Here at Rhamnous in the 6th century, 

986
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,200
the people had built a temple 

987
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,480
to the Greek goddess responsible for punishing those guilty of hubris. 

988
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,000
She was called Nemesis, a name that comes from the Greek verb "nemein" - 

989
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,240
meaning to give what is due. 

990
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,760
Now, after the Melian atrocity, 

991
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,560
it seemed like Athenian ambition and pride 

992
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,920
was beginning to over-reach itself. 

993
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,440
They not only had enemies abroad - 

994
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,760
they had an increasing number of enemies in Greece, 

995
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,440
and indeed an increasing number of enemies at home as well, 

996
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,520
who were beginning to think of democracy 

997
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,760
as perhaps the immoral inversion of the righteous order. 

998
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,440
The question was, 

999
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,560
as the glorious golden age of the 5th century drew to a close, 

1000
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,600
how would theatre and democracy, 

1001
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,720
which had so spectacularly grown up together, 

1002
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,840
survive in a much harsher and more difficult world? 

1003
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,840
Although the future of Athens now looked uncertain, 

1004
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,160
the past century had been a spectacular era, 

1005
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,320
Athens had invented and pioneered an array of things 

1006
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,920
which underpin our own civilisation. 

1007
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,640
From classical sculpture and architecture 

1008
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,680
to new directions in philosophy and history. 

1009
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,760
But for me, out of all those legacies, 

1010
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,360
two stand out as the most extraordinary... 

1011
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,040
First, democracy - 

1012
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Athens created the first democratic constitution in history 

1013
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,880
which has become a beacon across the centuries. 

1014
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,840
And second - at the very same time, 

1015
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,080
Athens invented a powerful and incisive new art form - 

1016
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,440
theatre - an innovation without which perhaps, 

1017
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,240
that democracy might never have survived.

Drama comes from the Greek word, "dram" - to do, to act, to perform. 

1019
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,400
And if there is one thing that has become abundantly clear 

1020
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,000
it's that theatre was never just mere entertainment, 

1021
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,840
never a passive spectator - 

1022
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,280
it was a performer in Athens' story in the ancient world. 

1023
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:02,080
From tragedy making our most important beliefs uncomfortable, 

1024
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,760
to comedy questioning and policing citizenship, 

1025
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,840
and keeping people in check. 

1026
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,040
Theatre was an institution that plugged into religious, civic, 

1027
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,200
political and military aspects of ancient Athenian society. 

1028
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,120
It was an extraordinary, and extraordinarily uncomfortable, 

1029
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,440
risky and yet essential part of Athenian life.
